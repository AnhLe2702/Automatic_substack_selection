Before using this macro, use the Import Image Sequence to open a Virtual Stack containing all your slides
for (i = 1; i < 1801; i=i+90) { //start at slide i=1, and for as long as i is less than 1801, start the next loop at slide i+90 
	run("Duplicate...", "duplicate range=" + i + "-" + (i+89)); //specify the range of the duplication, goes from i to i+89
	Label = getMetadata("Label"); //this function extracts out the label of the stack, not the title, but the stack label which is found next to the slide counter eg. 1/1800
	saveAs("Tiff", "/Volumes/lgrp05$/DBIO_MayorLab_DATA/Anh/Experiments/Timelapse-Videos/20220330/Trial/" + substring(Label, 0, 6)); //Save the extracted file to a folder
                                                                                                          called Trial with the label as the first 6 character in the Label
	close();
	selectWindow("15h,10min"); //Reselect the master slide with the total number of slides, this is optional
}
